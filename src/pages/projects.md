Inspired by [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS), Figma VRT lets you take snapshots of your Figma file and compare them against each other. This started out as a simple cli tool, then it became a Vue app, then an Electron app. It should probably be an actual Figma plugin but I was lazy.
