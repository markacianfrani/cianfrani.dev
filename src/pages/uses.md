# Stuff I Use

## Office

* üíª **M1 Mac Mini 8GB** - More computer than I'll ever need
* üñ• **LG 34WN80C-B** - Looks like absolute hot garbage. Do not recommend.
* üñ≤ **Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball** - It's fun to take the ball out during meetings.
* üñ± **Logitech MX Master 2s** - This thing actually sucks and was the most overrated thing I've ever bought.
* üñ± **Apple Trackpad** - For the one time every month when I need to zoom in on something.
* üí∫ **Herman Miller Aeron** - It's literally just a chair. Not that cool honestly.  
* **Autonomous SmartDesk** - I read reviews for three months and everyone said it was bad. It's pretty good and hasn't snapped in half.
* üñä **Studio Neat Mark Two**
* 150 index cards a month.

## Keebs

* ‚å®Ô∏è **IBM Model M (1995)** - The most prized possession I own. Unfortunately rarely gets used due to RSI.
* ‚å®Ô∏è **Ergodox EZ** - This thing is amazing and my fingers never leave the keyboard and I can't type on anything else for the rest of my life.
  * **Switches:** Glorious Pandas, lubed (not by me).
  * **Keycaps:** Some knockoff Godspeed keycaps I got off Amazon

## Software

* VS Code
* Sublime Text - For copy and pasting random notes, json blurbs, and definitely not API keys.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Personal wiki
* iTerm2 w/ [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - The one thing keeping me on macOS.

## Games and Sports
* **Currently playing:** Final Fantasy 14
